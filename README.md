Solar System Simulation with Three.js
This project is a 3D simulation of the solar system built using Three.js. It features realistic planets, a dynamic sun, a starfield background, and interactive camera controls. The simulation includes planets like Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, complete with textures, orbits, and rotation animations.

Assets
Mistry all textures textures were taken from Planetary Pixel Emporium site, the the exception are only planets rings and stars texture. I'm sure there are plenty different and better textures around the internet so feel free to replace them as you see fit

Quick Start
Install dependencies
npm i
Run the app
npm run dev
Features
Realistic Planets:

Each planet has unique textures, sizes, and rotation speeds. Earth includes city lights and a cloud layer. Saturn and Uranus have rings.

Dynamic Sun:
Animated plasma texture. Corona and glow effects. Point light for illumination.

Starfield Background:
Randomly distributed stars with subtle color variations. Smooth rotation for a dynamic effect. Interactive Controls: Use the mouse to rotate, zoom, and pan the camera.
